# Phase 5 Quality Audit

## Scope and baseline

The audit reviewed the Phase 1–4 React/Express/Supabase modular monolith, shared Zod contracts, Gemini boundary, planning workspaces, routes, tests, configuration, and production build. A checkpoint tag was created at `phase-4-complete-2026-10-27` before remediation.

## Findings and remediation

| Severity | Finding and evidence | Impact | Remediation/status | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HIGH | Event, planning, ideas, and AI routes have no authentication or ownership boundary. | Any reachable caller can read or mutate another event. | Mitigated at deployment boundary: production API access is now denied unless `AUTH_ENABLED=true`; real identity, ownership, and RLS remain required before enabling it. | Deployment guard, type-check, tests, build |
| HIGH | Copilot confirmation previously accepted client-supplied mutation values. | A caller could bypass model approval and submit arbitrary budget changes. | Fixed with a server-issued, event-bound, expiring proposal ID and current-value compare-and-swap validation. | Proposal route tests/checks and type/build verification |
| MEDIUM | Alignment documentation described Phase 3–4 features as absent. | Reviewers could not map implemented behavior to the problem statement. | Updated status and implementation documentation. | Documentation diff inspection |
| MEDIUM | Coverage script was configured without `@vitest/coverage-v8`. | Reproducible coverage evidence was unavailable. | Added the configured provider dependency. | `npm run test:coverage` now runs; latest verified total is 16.95% statements, 18.16% branches, 16.88% functions, 20.31% lines. |
| MEDIUM | Planning UI was create-only and swallowed recoverable workflow failures. | Users could not edit persisted records or reliably recover from save errors. | Added edit/delete/status controls, validation, retry states, and loading guards. | Type-check, lint, build, regression suite |
| LOW | Three lint warnings remain in existing Toast fast-refresh export and server startup logging. | No functional failure; code-quality noise remains. | Documented for later cleanup without suppressing the rules. | `npm run lint` |

## Criterion assessment

- **Problem alignment:** Wedding, birthday, community event creation; persisted budget/timeline/vendor workspaces; generated ideas; and AI Copilot routes are present. Event-specific AI prompting and structured validation are implemented. Rich event-type templates and full quote comparison remain partial.
- **Code quality:** Strict TypeScript, shared Zod schemas, typed API client, separate AI provider/prompts/service, deterministic budget calculations, and event-scoped services are present. Some feature components remain dense and should be split before a final release.
- **Security:** Secrets remain server-side, bodies are bounded, UUIDs and schemas are validated, AI output is parsed, and proposals are now server-issued. Missing authentication/ownership/RLS is the primary unresolved risk.
- **Efficiency:** AI calls are explicit, bounded, and rate-limited; budget arithmetic is local and deterministic. No private response cache exists. List endpoints still need pagination for public-scale deployment.
- **Testing:** 55 deterministic tests pass; coverage tooling is now installable. Live Supabase/Gemini and browser E2E tests remain optional/not available without credentials and browser tooling.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic landmarks, labels, focus styles, live AI status, button names, and retry/error text are present. Automated axe and full keyboard E2E evidence remain absent.

## Dependency audit

`npm audit --omit=dev` reports two moderate React Router advisories. The available remediation requires a breaking React Router 7 upgrade, so it was not applied automatically during this audit. The application does not use SSR hydration; the open redirect advisory still requires a planned dependency upgrade and navigation regression pass.

## Verification

Run:

```text
npm run type-check
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:coverage
git diff --check
```

The final report records the actual results and remaining warnings. The latest coverage run reports 16.95% statements, 18.16% branches, 16.88% functions, and 20.31% lines across the configured source scope.
