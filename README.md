## 🌐 Live Application

- **Production URL:** [https://eventcraft-ai-nwwd.onrender.com](https://eventcraft-ai-nwwd.onrender.com)
- **Deployment Platform:** Render (Unified Full-Stack Node.js Service)
- **Status:** Active & Operational

---

## ✨ Key Capabilities & Highlights

1. **Intelligent Event Wizard (5 Steps)**
   - Guided brief capturing event type, target headcount, dates, budget bounds, and stylistic themes.
   - Live validation via shared Zod schemas before persistence.

2. **Full-Featured Planning Workspaces**
   - **Interactive 3D Donut Budget Visualizer:** Real-time breakdown of estimated vs. actual expenses with over-budget alerts.
   - **3D Timeline Highway:** Multi-view timeline supporting **3D Highway**, **Milestones**, and **Run-of-Show** urgency clustering (Overdue, Due This Week, Upcoming, Completed).
   - **Vendor Directory:** Category-based vendor pipeline with contact tracking and booking stages.
   - **Curated Ideas Studio:** Theme-tailored aesthetic suggestions with quick voting and status management.

3. **Multi-Model Generative AI & Copilot**
   - **Full Plan Generation:** Produces cohesive, categorized budgets, time-sequenced milestones, vendor checklists, and bespoke ideas in a single generation.
   - **Interactive AI Copilot:** Context-aware conversational assistant capable of proposing concrete modifications (e.g., adding budget lines, reallocating funds).
   - **Safety First (Stage & Confirm):** Copilot proposals are staged server-side and require user confirmation before committing to workspaces.
   - **AI Providers:** Native support for Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, self-hosted Ollama/LM Studio models, and a built-in deterministic offline mode.

4. **Robust Dual-Database Architecture**
   - **Zero-Credential Local SQLite:** Uses Node's native `node:sqlite` for immediate out-of-the-box local operation.
   - **Production PostgreSQL via Supabase:** Enterprise-grade cloud persistence with Row-Level Security and complete migration history.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

EventCraft AI follows a **modular-monolith** pattern:

## 🚀 Quickstart — Local Development

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 24+ (tested with v24.11; required for built-in `node:sqlite`)
- **npm** 10+
- *(Optional)* [Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekjot9105-commits/EVENTCRAFT-AI.git
cd EVENTCRAFT-AI
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
*(The local SQLite mode and local deterministic AI work instantly without any keys. To use live Gemini, add `AI_PROVIDER=gemini` and your `GEMINI_API_KEY`).*

### 3. Launch Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

---

## 📦 Production Deployment

The application is deployed to **Render** as a single unified service where the Express backend serves the compiled Vite client assets:

```bash
# 1. Build client and server bundles
npm run build

# 2. Launch production server
npm run server:start
```

For complete deployment instructions, environment setup, and Supabase database migration steps, see [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
